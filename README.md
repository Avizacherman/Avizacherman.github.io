# Tic Tac Toe

[Tic Tac Toe](avizacherman.github.io)

My first web development project EVER! The code is messy, but it accomplishes it's purpose. Variable difficulty levels, scalable to 10 x 10 tic-tac-toe, two player mode, victory highlighting. 

## Difficulty Settings

Base difficulty is set to Medium: Computer plays to win, but occasionally makes a random move. 

Easy Mode: For player 2, enter the name: 'weeny sauce mode'. Computer makes moves at random
Medium Mode: For player, don't enter a name. Computer follows the hard-mode algorithm, with a small chance of making a random move.
Hard Mode: For player 2, 'rake me over the coals mode'. Computer makes moves to only win or tie.


## Needs Fixing:

- div-resizing
- Code could use some cleaning
